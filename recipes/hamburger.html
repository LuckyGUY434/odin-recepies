    <h1>Homemade Smash Burgers</h1>
    <p>This smash burger recipe makes super juicy burgers with crispy edges. Don't use</p>
    <p>meat that is leaner than 80/20 for best results, and make sure the meat is very</p>    
    <p>cold. I prefer to cook these outdoors to avoid smoking up the kitchen. These grill</p>
    <p>up very fast because of the high heat, so make sure you have everything ready</p>
    <p>to go!</p>
